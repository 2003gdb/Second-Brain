# Networking Inventory

**Purpose:** Track all networking components, endpoints, and API clients to avoid duplication and maintain consistency.

After implementing networking code, document it here with a concise description.

---

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| _None yet_ | `Core/Networking/` | _Add networking components as they're created_ |

---

## Notes

- **When to add**: After completing implementation of API clients, endpoints, or networking utilities
- **Location**: All networking code lives in `Core/Networking/`
- **How to describe**: One concise sentence explaining what endpoint/client it handles (not how)
- **Why track**: Avoid duplicate endpoints, maintain consistent API patterns, and identify networking layer responsibilities
