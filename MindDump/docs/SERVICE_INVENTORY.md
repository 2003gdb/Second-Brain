# Service Inventory

**Purpose:** Track all services and repositories to identify duplication and refactoring opportunities.

After implementing a new service or repository, document it here with a concise description.

---

| Service/Repository | Location | Purpose |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| _None yet_ | `Core/Services/` or `Core/Repositories/` | _Add services as they're created_ |

---

## Notes

- **When to add**: After completing implementation of any new Service or Repository
- **Location**: All services and repositories live in `Core/Services/` or `Core/Repositories/` (business logic layer)
- **How to describe**: One concise sentence explaining what it does (not how)
- **Why track**: Spot duplication early and identify refactoring opportunities
