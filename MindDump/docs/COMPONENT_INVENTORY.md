# Component Inventory

**Purpose:** Track all views and shared components to identify duplication and reuse opportunities.

After implementing a new view or shared component, document it here with a concise description.

---

| Component/View | Location | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|---------|
| _None yet_ | `Features/[Name]/Views/` or `Shared/Components/` | _Add components as they're created_ |

---

## Notes

- **When to add**: After completing implementation of any View or Shared Component
- **Location examples**: `Features/Notes/Views/`, `Features/Tags/Views/`, `Shared/Components/`
- **How to describe**: One concise sentence explaining what it displays/does (not how)
- **Why track**: Avoid rebuilding existing components and identify reuse opportunities
